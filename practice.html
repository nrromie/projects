            On July 3rd, I traveled to <b>Sitakunda</b> where I visited <b>Shohosrodhara Waterfall</b> and <b>Bashbaria Sea Beach</b>. I was <em>captivated by the natural beauty of Shohosrodhara</em> to some extent, but unfortunately, <strong>the authority there provided a terrible experience</strong>. They charged us double the usual price simply because we didn't negotiate. Additionally, we had to wait for over an hour to board the boat, which was also in a very poor condition. However, <i>I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Bashbaria Sea Beach.</i>
